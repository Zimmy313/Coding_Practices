# Coding_Practices

This repository contains my personal solutions to various **LeetCode** problems.  
I primarily work with:

- **SQL** – for database query problems  
- **Python** – for algorithms and data manipulation using **pandas**  
- **C** – for low-level, performance-focused problems  

## Update Schedule
The repository is **usually updated weekly** with new solutions and improvements.

## Structure
Each folder is organized by language and problem type:

- `Algo/`       → Algorithm solutions in Python and C  
- `Pandas/`     → Python solutions focusing on data manipulation using pandas  
- `Revise/`     → Interesting or tricky questions I plan to revisit  
- `SQL/`        → SQL query solutions  
- `cheatsheet/` → Quick-reference files for **C**, **Python**, and **SQL** built-in/common functions  
- `nameConverter.py` → Helper script for file naming  

## Quick Navigation
To move directly to the C folder (assuming at repo root):

```bash
cd Algo/round2Sep/C
```
