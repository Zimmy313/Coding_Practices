# Coding_Practices

This repository contains my personal solutions to various **LeetCode** problems.  
I primarily work with:

- **SQL** â€“ for database query problems  
- **Python** â€“ for algorithms and data manipulation using **pandas**  
- **C** â€“ for low-level, performance-focused problems  

## ðŸ“… Update Schedule
The repository is **usually updated weekly** with new solutions and improvements.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
Each folder is organized by language and problem type:

- Algo/       -> Algorithm solutions in Python and C
- Pandas/     -> Python solutions focusing on data manipulation using pandas
- Revise/     -> Interesting or tricky questions I plan to revisit
- SQL/        -> SQL query solutions
- nameConverter.py -> Helper script for file naming

Quick navigation to C folder for path setting(assuming at root):
cd Algo/round2Sep/C
gcc name.c -o name
